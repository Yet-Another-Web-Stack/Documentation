# Documentation
This is the project's wiki and documentation

The goal of the project is to provide a small flexible technology stack for the web that
avoids monolithic architecture due to structured interfaces and a single cross language, cross platform protocol.

Properties the stack should have:

* vendor neutral - MIT or Apache 2 licencing
* light weight - HTML5 CSS3, ECMAscript, Thrift protocol
* request reply and publish subscribe - http and websockets
* high performance - Thrift protocol, tcp/ip (websockets)
* cross language - Thrift protocol
* automatic language stub generation -Thrift compiler
* language agnostic network - Thrift protocol
* modular polyglot microservices - PHP, Java, Javascript, PERL, C#, C++
* evolving interfaces without breaking existing implementations -Thrift protocol
* explicit and centralized interface and bounded context design -Thrift IDL

Problem domains to solve:

* Cross language protocol - Thrift TCompact binary protocol
* Retain state in a cross language/platform way - Memcached, Apache Ignite, 
* Retain state for overall session - Do we need ACID here?
* Retain state on page controllers if needed - Do we need ACID here?

Opinion Maurice:

For state handling i would prefer Apache ignite. Memchached client protocol is supported, it is distributed and clusterable,
It integrates good with bigdata frameworks and hibernate and can handle ACID,
can also do messaging, grid, streaming and events.
