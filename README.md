# Documentation
This is the project's wiki and documentation

The goal of the project is to provide a flexible technology stack that
avoids monolithic architecture.

Properties the framework should have:

* vendor-neutral
* light-weight
* high-performance
* cross-language
* language agnostic networks
* polyglot microservices
* evolving interfaces without breaking existing implementations
